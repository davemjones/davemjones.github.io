## Pitch

Dave M Jones Personal Resume is a developer-focused portfolio website that helps potential employers, clients, and collaborators understand both professional capabilities and personal interests by providing a unique VSCode-inspired interface with terminal design elements.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Potential Employers**: Recruiters and hiring managers looking to assess technical skills and cultural fit
- **Clients**: Individuals or companies seeking development services and wanting to understand work style and expertise
- **Collaborators**: Fellow developers and professionals interested in networking and potential partnerships

### User Personas

**Hiring Manager** (30-50 years old)
- **Role:** Technical Recruiter or Engineering Manager
- **Context:** Reviewing candidates for software development positions
- **Pain Points:** Difficulty assessing both technical skills and personality fit from traditional resumes, lack of insight into candidate's passion projects
- **Goals:** Find developers who are not only technically competent but also show creativity and continuous learning

**Freelance Client** (25-45 years old)
- **Role:** Small Business Owner or Startup Founder
- **Context:** Looking for a developer to build or enhance their web presence
- **Pain Points:** Uncertainty about developer's actual capabilities, concern about communication and reliability
- **Goals:** Find a trustworthy developer who can deliver quality work and understand business needs

## The Problem

### Generic Resume Fatigue

Traditional developer portfolios often feel impersonal and fail to showcase the developer's unique personality and approach to problem-solving. Many portfolios look identical and don't effectively communicate the person behind the code.

**Our Solution:** Create a distinctive, developer-themed interface that reflects both technical skills and personal interests through innovative design.

### Limited Personal Insight

Most technical portfolios focus solely on professional experience without giving insight into the person's learning journey, mentors, and personal interests that shape their approach to development.

**Our Solution:** Include unique sections like "People Smarter than Me" and hobbies that provide a more complete picture of the developer's mindset and influences.

## Differentiators

### VSCode Terminal Aesthetic

Unlike traditional portfolio websites with generic business themes, we provide an immersive developer experience using VSCode dark theme colors and terminal-inspired design elements. This creates immediate connection with fellow developers and demonstrates attention to developer experience.

### Unique Content Sections

Unlike standard portfolios that only show work history, we provide dedicated sections for mentors/inspirations and personal hobbies. This approach gives visitors insight into the developer's learning mindset and work-life balance philosophy.

### Developer-First Design

Unlike corporate-style portfolios, we embrace the developer community aesthetic with authentic terminal interfaces and coding-inspired visual elements. This demonstrates genuine passion for the craft rather than just professional obligation.
