# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Portfolio Layout and Navigation
> Created: 2025-09-06
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Create a comprehensive portfolio website layout and navigation system that embodies a developer-focused aesthetic inspired by VSCode dark theme and terminal interfaces. The portfolio will serve as a personal showcase for Dave M. Jones, featuring a unique four-section navigation structure that reflects both professional expertise and personal interests.

The design will incorporate terminal-inspired elements, monospace typography, and a carefully curated color palette that creates a cohesive, professional, yet approachable developer experience. Drawing inspiration from modern developer portfolios like tamalsen.dev, the site will balance functionality with visual appeal.
